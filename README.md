**Description:**
I found a database of the artwork from the Modern Museum of Art (MoMA) in NYC. It was five years old but very thorough. Taking just the paintings with images, 
I seeded my backend API and ended up with 1,994 paintings. In this app, you can peruse all the paintings and save them to rooms you create and make your own exhibits.

**How to Get In on the Fun:**
* This project's backend/API was made with Ruby version: ruby 2.6.6p146 (2020-03-31 revision 67876) [x86_64-linux]
* Frontend courtesy of JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS, and HTML.
* Fork a copy and download the files from: 
    https://github.com/nmhummel/decurator-backend
    https://github.com/nmhummel/decurator-frontend
* Make sure you bundle install after cloning it.
* Additional installs on the backend include:
    $npm install --save redux-thunk
    $npm install react-redux
    $npm install react-router-dom
    $npm install redux-devtools-extension
* Run $rails db:migrate AND $rails db:seed to seed the database on the frontend.
* System dependencies include a console of some sort: Windows Power Shell, Command Prompt, Ubuntu, etc.
* Start your rails server by going into the backend folder: 
    $cd backend
    $rails s 
* On the front end, start your npm server by going into the backend folder:
    $npm start or $yarn start

**Copyright:**
I own none of these paintings. This is purely for recreational purposes. Thank you for the art, MoMA. https://www.moma.org/

**STATUS:** Near complete, barring tweaks to style.

**CONTRIBUTORS:**
This is my fifth and final project for Flatiron School. I don't expect this to grow into an internet sensation. If you want to add to it, just email me at natalie.hummel@gmail.com and let me know.
